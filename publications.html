            <h2>My Research Projects and Publications</h2>
            <p>My academic journey has been enriched by various research projects and publications that demonstrate my dedication to advancing knowledge and exploring interdisciplinary topics. Below is a summary of my key research work and ongoing projects.</p>

            <h3>Publications</h3>
            <h4>Survey Article on Hopfield Networks</h4>
            <p><strong>Status:</strong> In review for potential publication in "La Gazette de la Société Mathématique de France".</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This survey examines the mathematical underpinnings and applications of Hopfield Networks, focusing on their capacity for pattern recognition and memory modeling within the framework of artificial intelligence. This work bridges theoretical mathematics and machine learning, reflecting my interest in interdisciplinary research that connects mathematics with computer science.</p>

            <h3>Research Projects</h3>
            <h4>Phase Transitions in the Ising Model</h4>
            <p><strong>Institution:</strong> Université Paris-Est Créteil (UPEC)</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> During my research internship, I studied the phase transitions in the nearest-neighbor Ising model without an external magnetic field. I demonstrated the absence of phase transitions in one dimension and proved their existence in two dimensions using the Peierls argument. This project involved applying mathematical rigor to statistical mechanics, exploring concepts like the thermodynamic limit, Griffiths inequalities, and the evolution of spin correlation with temperature.</p>

            <h4>Machine Learning Framework for Commercial Paper Valuation</h4>
            <p><strong>Institution:</strong> BRED Banque Populaire</p>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Data Scientist Intern – Sales Trader Assistant</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Collaborated with a PhD-level data scientist to refine the mathematical basis of a machine learning model for commercial paper valuation. My contributions included proposing a relevant set of mathematical notations, reviewing the proper definition of mathematical objects, and co-authoring a research paper. This project allowed me to merge theoretical knowledge with practical data science applications and exposed me to academic writing and peer-reviewed publication processes.</p>

            <h4>Expected Project on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</h4>
            <p><strong>Institution:</strong> CentraleSupélec (Expected)</p>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Research on the properties and applications of GNNs as part of machine learning projects, which will leverage my background in graph theory and topological methods. This research will expand on my previous studies and contribute to my understanding of advanced computational techniques in data analysis.</p>

            <h3>Academic Contributions and Engagements</h3>
            <h4>Teaching and Mentorship</h4>
            <p><strong>Roles:</strong> Teaching assistant at ESSEC & CentraleSupélec and tutor at UPEC.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> My teaching experiences have not only strengthened my understanding of mathematical principles but have also reinforced my commitment to academia. Mentoring students and developing educational content for topics such as probability theory, linear algebra, and machine learning has prepared me to engage with future research as both a contributor and a guide for aspiring scholars.</p>

            <h4>Independent Research and Self-Study</h4>
            <p>My self-driven projects and extensive independent studies in topics like algebraic topology, quantum information, and TDA have laid the groundwork for future academic pursuits. These studies have directly contributed to my readiness to conduct impactful research and pursue a master’s and PhD with confidence.</p>

            <h3>Future Research Aspirations</h3>
            <p>Looking forward, I am committed to exploring further interdisciplinary research that merges mathematical theory with its applications in physics and computational science. My planned studies in Floer homology, elliptic operators, and intersection theory will support my pursuit of topics that bridge pure and applied mathematics, positioning me for meaningful contributions in both research and teaching.</p>
