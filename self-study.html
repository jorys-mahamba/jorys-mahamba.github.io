            <h2>My Dedication to Self-Study</h2>
            <p>My dedication to learning extends beyond formal academic settings into an extensive self-study journey, driven by a desire to deepen my understanding and prepare for advanced research. This continuous, independent pursuit has equipped me with a robust foundation in mathematical concepts and methods, which complements my academic and research goals.</p>

            <h3>Topics Studied Independently</h3>
            <p>Over the past few years, I have proactively explored advanced topics that align with my research interests and aspirations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algebraic Topology:</strong> I studied concepts like homology and cohomology using resources such as "Algebraic Topology" by Allen Hatcher. This exploration enhanced my grasp of topological spaces and their properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Topological Data Analysis (TDA):</strong> Merging my interest in topology and data science, I studied persistent homology and applied these principles to complex data sets through research articles and lecture notes by experts like Pr. Vidit Nanda.</li>
                <li><strong>Abstract Algebra:</strong> I expanded my knowledge beyond basic definitions to group theory, ring theory, and field theory, using "Abstract Algebra" by Dummit and Foote to develop a deeper understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Quantum Information and Computing:</strong> To bridge mathematics with modern applications, I explored topics in quantum computing with "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Nielsen and Chuang, focusing on quantum gates, algorithms, and information theory.</li>
                <li><strong>Graph Theory:</strong> Preparing for future research on Graph Neural Networks, I studied graph properties and algorithms relevant to machine learning applications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Planned Future Studies</h3>
            <p>To further my preparation for a masterâ€™s followed by a PhD, I have developed a detailed roadmap focusing on critical areas of study:</p>
            <h4>Phase 1: Preparation for Master's Thesis Pre-Proposal</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gauge Theory Basics:</strong> Studying "Geometry, Topology and Physics" by Mikio Nakahara and "Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity" by John Baez and Javier P. Muniain to grasp Yang-Mills equations and gauge group concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Fiber Bundles:</strong> Understanding the concept of principal and vector bundles through "Topology, Geometry and Gauge Fields: Foundations" by Gregory L. Naber.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Phase 2: Deepening Knowledge and Proposal Refinement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten Theories:</strong> Delving into "The Geometry of Four-Manifolds" by Donaldson and Kronheimer and "Monopoles and Four-Manifolds" by Kronheimer and Mrowka to explore moduli spaces and the construction of invariants.</li>
                <li><strong>Topological and Differential Geometry:</strong> Revisiting "Introduction to Smooth Manifolds" by John M. Lee for manifold theory and "Characteristic Classes" by Milnor and Stasheff for deeper insights into spin structures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Phase 3: Advanced Topics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Elliptic Operators and Index Theory:</strong> Studying "The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem: An Introduction" by Peter B. Gilkey to understand the importance of index theorems in geometry.</li>
                <li><strong>Moduli Spaces:</strong> Engaging with advanced sections of "Instantons and Four-Manifolds" by Freed and Uhlenbeck to deepen my understanding of moduli space construction and properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Floer Homology and Intersection Theory:</strong> Exploring "Floer Homology Groups in Yang-Mills Theory" by S.K. Donaldson and "Intersection Theory" by William Fulton to develop expertise in four-manifold topology.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact of Self-Study on My Academic Path</h3>
            <p>My self-study efforts have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Research Capabilities:</strong> Prepared me for complex projects such as my Hopfield Networks survey and Ising model research.</li>
                <li><strong>Broadened Interdisciplinary Insights:</strong> Reinforced my belief in mathematics as a versatile, unifying tool across various scientific domains.</li>
                <li><strong>Enriched Teaching Skills:</strong> Supported my roles as a teaching assistant and tutor, enabling me to explain advanced concepts effectively and guide students through challenging material.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Self-study has been an essential part of my journey, complementing formal education and paving the way for future academic and research endeavors. This commitment ensures I am well-prepared for rigorous master's programs and positions me for success in my ultimate pursuit of a PhD and a career in academia.</p>
