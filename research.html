            <h2>My Passion for Pluridisciplinary Research</h2>
            <p>My passion for research stems from a lifelong commitment to pluridisciplinarity and an insatiable curiosity about the intersections between different fields of knowledge. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively sought out projects and environments that bridge disciplines, from rigorous mathematics and physics to the computational world of data science and machine learning.</p>

            <h3>Origins of My Research Drive</h3>
            <p>My interest in research was sparked early in my academic career, where I found joy not only in mastering challenging concepts but also in understanding how they connect across disciplines. This drive for interconnected knowledge was fostered by my involvement in dual degrees and interdisciplinary programs, which exposed me to diverse methodologies and approaches. My commitment to interdisciplinarity is further exemplified by my simultaneous dedication to high-level sports, which demanded versatility and adaptability—qualities that have influenced my approach to problem-solving and research.</p>
            <p>During my time in CPGE, I was exposed to a curriculum that balanced the theoretical depth of mathematics and physics. This phase of my education instilled in me an appreciation for the elegance of mathematics as a universal language capable of uniting disparate scientific fields. Pursuing a dual BSc in Mathematics and Physics at UPEC allowed me to see firsthand how mathematical frameworks underpin physical theories, further fueling my desire to explore mathematical structures that connect seemingly unrelated domains.</p>

            <h3>Why Mathematics?</h3>
            <p>Mathematics, to me, is the ultimate tool for forging connections. Fields like category theory illustrate this beautifully by formalizing links between different areas of mathematics, while theories such as string theory and M-theory demonstrate how mathematical constructs can bridge mathematics and physics. These examples showcase why I am drawn to research that pushes the boundaries of what is known, exploring how foundational mathematical principles can provide insights into other scientific realms.</p>
            <p>This interest has been reflected in my research projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>My internship on the Ising model was a turning point where I applied mathematical rigor to explore phase transitions in statistical mechanics, demonstrating the power of mathematics to reveal new insights in physics.</li>
                <li>My work on Hopfield Networks for a survey article illustrated how mathematics can be adapted to modern challenges in computer science, blending theoretical and applied approaches to research.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Desire to Pursue Research</h3>
            <p>I am driven by the belief that research is the frontier of human knowledge—an endeavor where complex questions lead to breakthroughs that benefit not just one field but multiple areas of study. This belief is reflected in my pursuit of projects that connect disciplines, whether it be the mathematical study of topological data analysis or the exploration of moduli spaces in gauge theory.</p>
            <p>Engaging in research is more than personal fulfillment; it represents an opportunity to contribute to a collective effort that expands what we know. This is why I seek environments that not only foster academic excellence but also encourage cross-disciplinary interactions. My experiences in both structured academic programs and independent studies have prepared me to thrive in such settings, where different approaches and perspectives can come together to create innovative solutions.</p>

            <h3>Commitment to Teaching and Mentorship</h3>
            <p>My aspiration to become a professor stems from my firm belief in the symbiosis between research and teaching. Research is the avenue for innovation, while teaching is the platform for disseminating that knowledge and inspiring the next generation. I have taken on roles as a teaching assistant and tutor at UPEC and ESSEC & CentraleSupélec, where I conveyed complex mathematical concepts and nurtured students' understanding. These experiences have solidified my commitment to teaching as an integral part of my career.</p>
            <p>Being a professor would allow me to contribute not only through my research but also by inspiring future mathematicians and scientists. I view teaching as a way to amplify my impact, fostering curiosity and equipping students with the tools they need to make their own breakthroughs. My dedication to teaching is also reflected in my volunteer work, such as coaching in karate, where I developed communication and mentorship skills that are invaluable in an academic setting.</p>

            <h3>Why a Master’s Degree in Mathematics?</h3>
            <p>Pursuing a master’s degree in mathematics at a prestigious institution is the logical next step in my journey. I seek an environment that offers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research Excellence:</strong> Access to leading experts and cutting-edge research that will challenge and inspire me.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive and Diverse Curriculum:</strong> Courses that span a wide array of mathematical disciplines, aligning with my interdisciplinary interests.</li>
                <li><strong>A Vibrant Academic Community:</strong> Opportunities to engage with peers and professors who share a passion for exploring the unknown, pushing the boundaries of mathematical thought.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A master's program will not only deepen my knowledge but also provide the ideal setting for me to contribute meaningfully to research, laying the groundwork for PhD-level studies and beyond.</p>

            <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
            <p>My goal is to make impactful contributions to the fields of mathematics and its applications in theoretical physics and computational science. By focusing on research that creates bridges across disciplines, I hope to contribute original ideas that resonate beyond the confines of mathematics and influence how we approach complex scientific questions.</p>
            <p>As both a researcher and an educator, I aim to inspire students and contribute to a culture of inquiry and discovery, where learning and research intersect to advance human understanding.</p>
