            <h2>Extended Profile</h2>
            <p>I am Jorys Mahamba, an aspiring academic with a profound passion for mathematics, theoretical physics, and computer science. My journey through academia and personal development has been shaped by a commitment to excellence, resilience, and interdisciplinary exploration.</p>

            <h3>Early Academic Achievements and Intellectual Precocity</h3>
            <p>My academic career has been distinguished by early achievements and rapid progress through the French education system. Recognized for my intellectual giftedness, I skipped multiple grades, including Grande Section, CE2, and 5ème. This precocious academic trajectory culminated in my enrollment in the performance class of Terminale S*, where I began intensive preparations for the rigorous Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles (CPGE). This step marked the beginning of my deep engagement with mathematics and physics at an advanced level.</p>

            <h3>Commitment to High-Level Sports</h3>
            <p>Throughout my youth (2012-2023), I balanced my academic pursuits with a deep commitment to high-level sports. I competed in handball, karate, and badminton, training and competing at national and international levels. These experiences taught me essential qualities such as discipline, perseverance, and strategic thinking, which have greatly influenced my academic and research approach. Competing in these sports has also instilled a sense of teamwork, resilience, and the ability to handle high-pressure situations—qualities that continue to serve me well in my research and professional pursuits.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Studies and CPGE Experience</h3>
            <p>At just 15 years old, I embarked on the challenging CPGE program, which included coursework in PCSI, PC, and finally PC* as a 5/2 student. The experience was rigorous and demanding, pushing me to grow rapidly in both maturity and academic depth. Though balancing the program at such a young age was challenging, it equipped me with invaluable skills such as time management, personal discipline, and the ability to thrive under pressure. This experience shaped not only my academic knowledge but also my character, building a foundation of humility and determination.</p>

            <h3>Transition to University</h3>
            <p>After completing CPGE, I pursued a dual Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Physics at Université Paris-Est Créteil (UPEC). This phase marked a pivotal point in my academic career. In the first semester, I excelled and secured the top rank in my cohort due to my solid background and hard work. However, during the second semester, my interests shifted more towards advanced topics, and I found the rigid curriculum less stimulating. I dedicated more time to self-study, delving into advanced algebra and topology, and committed myself intensively to a research internship on the Ising model. Although my focus on independent study affected my second-semester grades, I still managed to graduate first overall in the Mathematics and dual-degree cohorts.</p>

            <h3>Master's Degree and Evolving Academic Interests</h3>
            <p>I decided to pursue a master’s degree in Data Sciences & Business Analytics at ESSEC Business School & CentraleSupélec. This choice was influenced by my growing interest in the intersection of mathematics and computer science, particularly as AI and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) gained prominence. I was also motivated by the dual perspectives offered by this program, bridging the gap between applied research and real-world applications, and the prestige of the two institutions. However, I soon realized that my true passion lies in theoretical research and teaching, prompting me to plan a transition to a master’s program focused solely on pure mathematics.</p>

            <p>My time in the master's program has been far from idle. I have actively pursued independent learning and taken on research projects to maintain my connection with the mathematical community. This has included authoring a survey article on Hopfield Networks, with the aim of publication in "La Gazette de la Société Mathématique de France," and preparing for future research in Graph Neural Networks. I have also taken on roles as a teaching assistant and academic tutor, further affirming my commitment to a future in academia.</p>

            <h3>Aspirations for Academic and Research Excellence</h3>
            <p>My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the fields of mathematics, theoretical physics, and their intersections with modern computational methods. I am deeply committed to advancing knowledge through innovative research and inspiring the next generation of scholars through teaching. The interdisciplinary approach that I have adopted throughout my academic journey has equipped me with the versatility and critical thinking needed to explore new horizons in these fields.</p>

            <p>By blending my mathematical rigor, research experience, and lifelong dedication to learning, I aim to make impactful contributions to academia and continue the tradition of pushing the boundaries of human understanding in mathematics and physics.</p>
