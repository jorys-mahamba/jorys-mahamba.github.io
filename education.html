            <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
            <p>My educational journey has been marked by an unrelenting pursuit of knowledge, the development of advanced skills in mathematics and physics, and an openness to interdisciplinary learning that bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and applied research.</p>

            <h3>Pre-College Academic Path</h3>
            <p>My journey began with a series of accelerated advancements through the French education system, where I skipped the Grande Section, CE2, and 5ème due to my intellectual giftedness. This early exposure to accelerated learning shaped my problem-solving skills and instilled a strong sense of discipline and curiosity. I later joined the performance class of Terminale S* in high school, a preparatory step for the Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles (CPGE), known for its demanding coursework that prepares students for entry into top engineering and scientific institutions.</p>

            <h3>CPGE: Foundational Years in Advanced Studies</h3>
            <p>I began the CPGE curriculum at 15, an exceptionally young age for this intensive program, progressing through PCSI (Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering Science), PC (Physics and Chemistry), and then PC* as a 5/2 student. These years were transformative, challenging me academically and personally. The curriculum covered advanced topics in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advanced Calculus and Analysis:</strong> Rigorous proofs, real analysis, and multivariable calculus.</li>
                <li><strong>Theoretical and Applied Physics:</strong> Mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum theory.</li>
                <li><strong>Complex Problem-Solving:</strong> Engaging with complex problem sets that required deep understanding and innovative thinking.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite the challenges of balancing this workload at a young age, I emerged with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhanced analytical and organizational skills, crucial for managing high-pressure academic settings.</li>
                <li>A strong foundation in mathematical proofs and logical reasoning.</li>
                <li>A newfound maturity and resilience, learning to embrace challenges as growth opportunities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>University Studies: Dual BSc in Mathematics and Physics at UPEC</h3>
            <p>After CPGE, I transitioned to Université Paris-Est Créteil (UPEC) to complete a dual BSc in Mathematics and Physics, graduating first in my mathematics cohort and the dual-degree cohort. This phase of my education solidified my understanding and introduced me to advanced mathematical concepts and physical theories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Courses in topology, measure theory, and probability theory, where I excelled (e.g., scoring 19/20 in topology and 17/20 in measure theory).</li>
                <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Quantum mechanics and statistical physics formed the core of my physics coursework.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During my final year, I conducted a research internship focusing on the Ising model and statistical mechanics, where I:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demonstrated the absence of phase transitions in one dimension and established their existence in two dimensions using Peierls arguments.</li>
                <li>Studied the Griffiths inequalities and analyzed spin correlation evolution with temperature.</li>
                <li>Applied mathematical proofs and analytical techniques to derive key properties of statistical systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Extracurricular Engagement and Self-Study</h3>
            <p>While at university, I complemented my formal education with significant self-study and independent projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Algebraic Topology and Abstract Algebra:</strong> During the second semester of my bachelor's degree, I delved into advanced topology and expanded my knowledge in abstract algebra, which had previously been unexplored in my formal coursework.</li>
                <li><strong>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Quantum Information:</strong> I self-studied these fields to bridge my interest in mathematics and its applications to computer science and machine learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Survey Article on Hopfield Networks:</strong> I authored a comprehensive survey on Hopfield Networks, analyzing their mathematical foundations and potential applications, which is currently under consideration for publication in "La Gazette de la Société Mathématique de France."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Master's Program: Data Sciences & Business Analytics at ESSEC & CentraleSupélec</h3>
            <p>I enrolled in a master’s program in Data Sciences & Business Analytics offered by ESSEC Business School and CentraleSupélec. This program provided me with an interdisciplinary view of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Studied fundamental algorithms and statistical methods that underpin AI technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Computational Modeling and Data Analysis:</strong> Gained practical knowledge in handling and analyzing large datasets.</li>
                <li><strong>Teaching and Mentorship:</strong> I took on roles as a teaching assistant and academic tutor, teaching mathematics, probability theory, and machine learning concepts to master's students, enhancing my teaching skills and confirming my interest in academia.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite the program's focus on business applications, I realized my true passion lies in theoretical research and academic teaching.</p>

            <h3>Research Internship at BRED Banque Populaire</h3>
            <p>I gained practical experience during my internship at BRED Banque Populaire, where I worked as a Data Scientist Intern and Sales Trader Assistant. My contributions included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mathematical Foundations for ML Models:</strong> Collaborated on enhancing the mathematical rigor of a machine learning model for Commercial Paper valuation.</li>
                <li><strong>Paper Co-Authoring:</strong> Reviewed and contributed to a research paper being prepared for submission, focusing on frameworks for financial data analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This experience reinforced my skills in applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems and collaborating on academic publications.</p>
