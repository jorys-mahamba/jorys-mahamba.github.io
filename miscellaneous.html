            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>My love for philosophy began in <strong>twelfth grade</strong>, sparked by an inspiring lecture from Dr. Stéphane Floccari, who emphasized the importance of daily reflection. This led me to deeper exploration during my first year of <strong>CPGE</strong>, where I encountered <em>Nietzsche</em>. His ideas resonated profoundly, revealing that philosophical reflection had been part of my thinking since childhood. Over time, I’ve explored philosophies such as <em>Greek pantheism</em> and reflected on contrasting views like <em>Rousseau’s</em> interpretation of the ancient <strong>Chinese Theory of Good Human Nature</strong>. Surprisingly, <strong>anime</strong> has influenced my journey as well—characters like <em>Monkey D. Luffy</em> from <em>One Piece</em> inspire me daily with their ideals of liberty and authenticity.</p>

            <h2>Classical Architecture</h2>
            <p>My fascination with <strong>classical architecture</strong> started with the awe-inspiring columns of <strong>The French Panthéon</strong>. This initial exposure evolved into a lasting interest in <em>classical</em> and <em>neoclassical architecture</em>, celebrated for its timeless elegance and intellectual gravitas.</p>

            <h2>The Art of Tea</h2>
            <p>Tea is not just a beverage to me; it represents culture, tradition, and tranquility. My passion for tea has taken me through its rich traditions—from cultivation and transformation to preparation and tasting. One of my aspirations is to open a <strong>tea shop</strong> in my later years, where I can share this passion and create a space for reflection and community.</p>

            <h2>Urban Culture</h2>
            <p>Growing up in the <strong>Paris suburbs</strong> as a mixed-race individual, I was deeply influenced by <strong>urban culture</strong>. Music, film, and sports shaped my experiences, with icons like <em>2Pac</em>, <em>Eddie Murphy</em>, and <em>LeBron James</em> becoming influential figures in my life. Visual media such as <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em> and <em>The Pursuit of Happyness</em> have further deepened my understanding of diverse perspectives, emphasizing the power of storytelling and resilience.</p>
